This JavaScript code manages a theme toggle functionality that switches between dark mode and light mode.

Key Features:
Checkbox Listener: It listens for changes on a checkbox (#theme-switch), which acts as the toggle for switching between themes.
Theme Toggle: When the checkbox is toggled, it adds or removes the dark-mode class from the body, .calculator, and .display elements to switch between light and dark themes.
Icon Change: The icon in the label (.switch-label) changes based on the state of the checkbox:
If the checkbox is checked (dark mode), it displays the moon icon (ðŸŒ™).
If the checkbox is unchecked (light mode), it displays the sun icon (ðŸŒž).
This provides a simple way to toggle between light and dark themes with a visual change in the icon representing the current theme.
